# Nightly builds 

Vizzu uses a CI build environment. The builds are available on the following URLs. 
However you should use these only for development purposes since they are subject to
frequent and sometimes unstable changes.

* build from the HEAD commit of the main branch: https://vizzu-lib-main.storage.googleapis.com/lib/vizzu.js
* all builds on the main branch of the past 30 days:
  
  https://vizzu-lib-main-sha.storage.googleapis.com/lib-HASH/vizzu.js
  
  where HASH is the first 7 character of the commit's git hash.
